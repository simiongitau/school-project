            Biovision Foundation is a Swiss non-profit organization with a
            global mission to alleviate poverty and improve the livelihoods of
            rural people in Africa while maintaining the natural resources and
            diversity that sustains life. Our chairman is Dr. Hans Rudolf
            Herren, one of the world's leading researchers in biological pest
            control. He has been living and researching in Africa for over 20
            years. In 1995 he won the World Food Prize, the first Swiss to
            receive this honour. From 1994 until 2005 he has been the CEO and
            Director of the International Centre of Insect Physiology and
            Ecology (icipe) in Nairobi, Kenya. In May 2005 Dr. Herren officially
            took over presidency of the internationally active Millenium
            Institute in Washington DC. This institute supports the governments
            of developing countries by providing resources for sustainable
            development. While icipe plays a major role in the control of pests,
            parasites and disease vectors in developing countries. Biovision
            Foundation functions as an intermediary between research institutes
            and local users in order to ensure that benefits of science reach
            the people who need them most.

            Animal feed needs to meet the requirements of the animal. For cattle
            it must contain a certain structure to keep the stomach healthy, and
            for all animals it must contain dry matter, various groups of
            nutrients, minerals and trace-elements and should not be mouldy or
            mixed with dirt and soil nor contain poisonous ingredients (for
            example pesticides or herbicides on crop residues). The composition
            of feeds in a ration depends on the type of animals being fed and
            their stage of production. Cattle and goats, being ruminants, are
            better equipped to digest crude fibre than pigs or chickens. Young
            animals need more protein than adult animals, while animals in milk
            need a higher protein content in the ration than non lactating
            animals. Generally animals must have a ration containing: Energy
            (from carbohydrates and fats) to maintain the body and produce
            (milk, meat, work). The carbohydrates and fats not needed for
            production are converted to fat and stored in the body. Protein is
            needed for body building (growth) and maintenance as well as milk
            production. Without protein there would be no body weight gain nor
            milk production. Excess protein is converted to urea and fat
            Minerals help in body building as well as in biological regulation
            of growth and reproduction. They are also a major source of
            nutrients in milk. Vitamins help regulate the biological processes
            in the body and become a source of nutrients in milk Water helps all
            over in body building, heat regulation, biological processes as well
            as a large constituent of milk production as well as eggs.
